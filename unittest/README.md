## A minimal setup with Python's unittest to get you started

#### Setup

Does not need any additional libraries, as unittest is part of the
standard Python library.


#### Running the tests

To execute the tests run `python -m unittest todo_project_name_test`

The methods starting with 'test_' are going to be discovered automatically.
