# Theatrical Players Refactoring Kata

Based on [Emily's Bash repository](https://github.com/emilybache/Theatrical-Players-Refactoring-Kata)

Based on the first chapter of 'Refactoring' by Martin Fowler, 2nd Edition. 

## What you need to change

Refactoring is usually driven by a need to make changes. In the book, Fowler adds code to print the statement as HTML in addition to the existing plain text version.
He also mentions that the theatrical players want to add new kinds of plays to their repertoire, for example history and pastoral.

## Automated tests
In his book Fowler mentions that the first step in refactoring is always the same - to ensure you have a solid set of tests for that section of code.
However, Fowler did not include the test code for this example in his book.
An approval testing approach is used here to rapidly getting existing code under test and to support refactoring.
You should review these tests and make sure you understand what they cover and what kinds of refactoring mistakes they would expect to find.
